  "intro": "<0>Automatic Scanners</0><1>Automatic Scanners are Genshin tools that can automatically scan in-game data by manipulating your mouse movements, taking screenshots of the game, and then scanning information from those screenshots. These are low-risk tools that can help you automate a lot of manual process with scanning artifacts for GO. As any tools that indirectly interact with the game, althought their usage is virtually undetectable, <1>there could still be risk with using them.</1> Users discretion is advised.</1><p>The most important aspect of using these Scanners with GO is the output format:</p><3><0>As of <1>v5.21.0</1>, GO can import artifact data in the <3>mona-uranai</3> format. </0><1>As of <1>v6.0.0</1>, GO can import data in the <3>Genshin Open Object Description (GOOD)</3> format.</1></3><p>Below are several scanners that have been tested with GO.</p><5>To upload the exported file, go to <1>Database</1> page, and upload your file in the \"Database Upload\" section.</5>",
